# chuck-norris

## A Spring Boot Web Application that displays random Chuck Norris jokes

It is a Spring MVC Application with Thymeleaf.

The source of the jokes is at Maven Central Repository: guru.springframework:chuck-norris-for-actuator:2.4.0

Spring guru John Thompson had the idea to build such application in his udemy course.
